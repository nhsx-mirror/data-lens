This script scrapes the NHS Dictionary data and inserts it into Elastic search.

Script starts at https://datadictionary.nhs.uk/

The script works by getting going to various pages on the site that have a similar structure
it goes to each section and then gets a list of sections from that page and then processes them 1 by 1 and then 
adds them to a list, the list is then batched to elastic Search and the script continues.

An example of JSON data sent to elastic search ...
