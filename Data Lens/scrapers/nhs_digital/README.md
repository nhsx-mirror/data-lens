search_page.py

This script scrapes the search page of NHS digital, https://digital.nhs.uk/search.

It goes through a list of filters that are set as command arguments i.e `publication`, `dataset` these
can be found on the left-hand side of the search page.

For each filter it then looks to see if there are any date filters, if so it then follows those. We have structured
it like this as the page has a bug on it whereby it only returns 1000 hits, meaning we were missing data
